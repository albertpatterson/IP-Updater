# IP-Updater
The simplest way to access a server is via a URL created from the IP address. However, this URL will only work temporarily after setting up the server, as IP Addresses are typically dynamic. Static IP addresses and hosting services are available but they are quite expensive. For the hobbyist, it may be sufficient just to keep the URL up to date as the IP address changes, which is what this tool does.
